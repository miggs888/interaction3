                <p>Below is an infographic displaying members of the House of Representatives. Each member is shown as either a red or blue dot (Republican & Democrat, respectively).</p>
                <p>They are randomly distributed along the Y-axis of their respective party lines. The position of each member on the X-axis shows that member's percentage of votes for legislation for the oppsite side. <strong>Closer to the center shows more bipartisan voting statistics!</strong></p>
